# UFO Sightings Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filtemultiple criteria at the same time. The web page now includes filters for the date, city, state, and etc... allowing users to perform a more refined search based on specific criteria. The goal is to make it easier for users to analyze the UFO sightings data and to gain insights into these occurrences.

## Summary

### Drawback of the Webpage
One drawback of the current webpage design is that it only allows for filtering based on exact matches. If a user enters "California" in the "State" filter, the table will only display UFO sightings from California. If the user enters "CA" instead, the filter will not return any results. To improve the user experience, the filters should be enhanced to support partial matches or case-insensitive searches, allowing users to obtain better search results.

### Recommendations for Further Development
Interactive Map Visualization: To provide a more engaging user experience, an interactive map visualization could be integrated into the webpage. The map could display the locations of UFO sightings based on the selected filters, allowing users to explore the geographical distribution of sightings more easily.

Enhanced Date Filter: Instead of only allowing users to enter exact dates, an enhanced date filter could include a date range selector option. This would enable users to easily select a range of dates and observe trends in UFO sightings over a period of time.

These enhancements would make the UFO sightings analysis webpage more user-friendly and provide more informative visualizations for users to gain insights into UFO sightings.
